# CINEMADISE Landing Page

## Overview

CINEMADISE is a concept landing experience for a Ugandan cinema ticketing platform. The prototype highlights value propositions for moviegoers and cinema operators, showcases product mockups, and captures early-access leads.

## Live Sections

1. **Home (`index.html`)**: Hero, dual CTA forms, benefits, product showcase, booking flow overview, and primary conversion call-to-actions.
2. **About (`about.html`)**: Brand story, mission, vision, values, and traction highlights.
3. **Team (`team.html`)**: Leadership spotlight, culture pillars, and recruitment CTA.
4. **Contact (`contact.html`)**: Direct contact details, inquiry form, FAQs, and partnership invitation.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5** for static markup
- **CSS3** for layout and visual design (`style.css` plus inline page-specific styles)
- **Vanilla JavaScript** for CTA toggling and submission stubs (`index.html` footer script)

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a modern browser to explore the landing experience.
3. Navigate to `about.html`, `team.html`, or `contact.html` for the additional sections.

## Design System Highlights

- Color palette anchored on warm neutrals (`#6C4324`, `#974420`, `#EE481A`, `#FCFCFC`).
- Typography: Inter family with emphasis weights for headings and CTAs.
- Components: Responsive navigation, card grids, CTA forms, stat bands, and gradient hero banners.

## Assets

All imagery lives under `images/` and is optimized for static use in the prototype. Replace with production-ready assets before launch.
